### What is a Transaction?

- A **transaction** is a group of operations that must be treated as **one unit**.
- In database terms, it follows **ACID**:
  - **Atomicity** → all succeed OR all fail
  - **Consistency** → data stays correct
  - **Isolation** → concurrent transactions don’t break each other
  - **Durability** → once committed, data is permanent

#### Why Transaction Alone Is NOT Enough to solve high concurrency ?

- Because under very high concurrency:
  - DB locks become bottlenecks
  - too many transactions slow DB
  - row lock contention increases
  - deadlocks appear
  - DB CPU explodes
- Example : 100k users claiming coupon. If every request directly:
  1. begin transaction
  2. query stock
  3. update stock
  4. insert records
  5. commit
- Database may collapse.

### What is `@Transactional`?

- `@Transactional` is implemented by AOP to automatically manage transaction lifecycle for business methods.

  ```java
  @Service
  public class CouponService {

      @Transactional
      public void claimCoupon(Long userId, Long campaignId) {
          // 1. check stock
          // 2. deduct stock
          // 3. create user coupon
          // 4. create claim record
      }
  }
  ```

  - Spring automatically start transaction before method, commit if success or rollback if exception.

- How it actually works (very important for debugging)
  - Step 1: Spring creates a proxy object —— YourService → Proxy → Real Method
  - Step 2: AOP intercepts method call —— call method() → [AOP intercept] → start transaction → execute method → success>commit/error>rollback
- Transaction only works on PUBLIC methods
- Self-call will FAIL (classic bug) —— because AOP proxy is bypassed

  ```java
  public void A() {
      B(); // ❌ transaction NOT applied
  }

  @Transactional
  public void B() {}
  ```

- Default rollback only for RuntimeException
